#🎵 MoodMelody

## 💡 Description of the Project

**MoodMelody** is a real-time, web-based music recommendation app that curates a personalized playlist based on how you're feeling. Instead of scrolling through random or generic playlists on streaming services, users simply describe their mood in a short sentence — and MoodMelody takes care of the rest.

Using the **Twinword Emotion Analysis API**, the app detects the user’s dominant emotion from their text input (e.g., joy, sadness, anger). That emotion is then mapped to a fitting music genre tag and used to fetch top tracks through the **Last.fm API**. The result is a playlist that matches your emotional vibe — without wasting time scrolling.

Whether you're heartbroken, hyped, calm, or angry — MoodMelody tunes in to how you feel and plays what fits.
